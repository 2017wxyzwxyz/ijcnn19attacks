## Data 
The data used in this project comes from the [UCR/UEA archive](http://timeseriesclassification.com/TSC.zip), which contains the 85 univariate time series datasets. 

## Code

## Prerequisites
All python packages needed are listed in [pip-requirements.txt](https://github.com/hfawaz/ijcnn19ensemble/blob/master/src/utils/pip-requirements.txt) file and can be installed simply using the pip command.

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)  
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)  
* [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)  
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)  
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  
* [tensorflow-gpu](https://www.tensorflow.org/)  
* [keras](https://keras.io/)  
* [h5py](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/build.html)
* [keras_contrib](https://www.github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib.git)

## Results 

The following animation shows how the accuracy and the time series shape variation with respect to the amount of perturbation allowed.
